# Project repository: diploid genome assembly

## Stage 1 - split reads by haplotype

## Some notes of things to do
 * Use latest patch of GRCh38 for partitioning
 * Consensus: Arrow/Racon
 * Variant calling: FreeBayes, DeepVariant, WhatsHap genotype
 * Use BACs to compute QV scores
 * Evaluate phasing/assembly in H1-only/H2-only assembly; is it any better?
